__Notes:__

The Sigil Linux AppImage is built on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) and is targeting glibc 2.35 and higher. Use ldd --version to see if your system at least has a shot at being able to use the AppImage. Don't forget to make sure the AppImage is executable after downloading. Trouble is not expected but be safe and backup your existing Sigil preferences (if you have any) before trying the AppImage.
