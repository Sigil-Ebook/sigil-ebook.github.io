Welcome to the new Sigil home page. This is where all release announcements and any status updates will be posted. While this site is Sigil specific everything will still be a cross post from my [personal blog](https://john.nachtimwald.com). My blog is more than just Sigil so be warned if all you care about is Sigil then this is where you want to be.

This does mean that the [Sigil dev blog](http://sigildev.blogspot.com/) hosted on Blogger is being retired now that Sigil has an official website. The Blogger site will remain up for as long as google wants simply for historic reasons. The old Sigil [homepage](https://code.google.com/p/sigil/) will also remain up but point here instead.
