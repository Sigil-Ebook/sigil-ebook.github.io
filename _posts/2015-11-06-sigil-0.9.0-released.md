__Sigil 0.9.0__ is the first full post Sigil 0.8.7 release. It includes \*\*all\*\* of the changes and improvements from our Sigil-0.8.900 series of pre-releases and it has shown itself to be stable in our tests. The changes from our last pre-release Sigil-0.8.901 are almost all bug fixes:

*   Add “Use Bundled Python” option to bring sanity and choice to Python3 Interpreter selection
*   Merge EmbeddedPython code across platforms and fix python flags for all platforms
*   Properly build translation base.ts to prevent blank message fields being generated by tr()
*   Update to the latest translations from transifex
*   Allow PrettyPrint\_Gumbo to condense whitespace where allowed
*   Fix bug in PluginRunner auto-repair modified xml (opf, ncx), do not check xml with xhtml wellformed check
*   Fix bug in plugin epub3 interface, conversion of properties with null strings to None
*   Restore ability to override hunspell dictionary locations on Linux with SIGIL\_DICTIONARIES env var
*   Restore ability to build Sigil against system hunspell libraries on Linux
*   Adjust pluginhunspell.py to try to find system hunspell if bundled hunspell is not built/installed
*   Fix hang/slowness in TOC creation when huge number of headings all exist in the same file
*   Performance speedups for NCX writing to help with slow ToC Creation
*   Fix bug for better detecting comments in sanitycheck.py
*   Fix bug for Adding Blank xhtml files to an epub3
*   Fix bug for Issue 140 – TOC gets cut-off under some platforms (lxml needs utf-8 not unicode)
*   Add cmake option INSTALL\_BUNDLED\_DICTS to enable/disable installation of bundled hunspell dictionaries
*   Allow SIGIL\_DICTIONARIES env var to specify multiple paths (colon delimited)
*   Fix bug in sanitycheck.py error message creation
*   Identify woff files as fonts when importing epubs
*   Fixes for nbsp being potentially “lost” when linking in stylesheets and when splitting and merging chapters
*   Fix for lost whitespace inside text containing tags when pretty printing
*   Workaround for broken QShortCut in Qt 5.4.X see Issue 149  
*   cleanup up some compiler warnings
    
    

One new “feature” is that the Mac OS X Package has been code signed.  
It is hoped this release will provide a stable and up-to-date version of Sigil while development work begins on adding some additional epub3 support features.

The Sigil-0.9.0 release can be downloaded from:  
<https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases/tag/0.9.0>

__Don’t Forget FlightCrew__  
Please note, the epub2 validator FlightCrew has been converted to a plugin for Sigil 0.8.900 and later.  
This plugin reamins unchanged from the last release and can be downloaded from the official Sigil-Ebook flightcrew repository if you have not already installed it.

__Attention Mac OS X Users__  
Per the recommendation of <http://www.python.org>, see <https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/>, due to bugs and the age of Apple’s internal Tcl library, you should also download and install ActiveState’s ActiveTcl Community Edition.

To get the latest bug fixes, Sigil-0.9.0’s embedded Python has been linked with the very latest version: Tcl 8.6.4.1 

We may not redistribute this Package with Sigil due to ActiveState’s binary non-redistribution policy.

So please download and install this version of ActiveState’s Active Tcl Community Edition, until we get a chance to do our own build of Tcl 8.6.4.1 from source for future releases. ActiveState is a primary contributor to <http://www.python.org> and a respected and trusted source for python and tcl/tk related binaries on both Windows and Mac OS X.

Version: 8.6.4.1
