Sigil 0.9.14 will mark the last version that uses QtWebKit, and will be the last version to support editing in BookView. [More here](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/wiki#sigil-moving-to-qtwebengine).

Be aware that Sigil-0.9.14 still enforces the need for epub3 to have and support an NCX so that it generates as backward a compatible epub as possible. This may be relaxed in future releases.
