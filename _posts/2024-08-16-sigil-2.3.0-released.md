Sigil version 2.3.0 represents a mix of bug fixes and new features. Sigil 2.3.0 also marks the first version to only support building with Qt6.

### Changes in this Release

<div markdown="1">
#### New Features
- removed support for building Sigil with Qt5 as our code had become a rats nest of qt version ifdefs. See our git branch "qt5final" for the very last buildable version of Sigil under Qt5
- our new minium version to build Qt is Qt 6.4.0 or later
- removed the need and usage for Qt6Compat5 as its contents were deprecated and will go away eventually
- added support for using the ICU library to help replace the range of encodings supported by the old QTextCodec
- we are now using NFC unicode normalization form for all content, links, urls, and file paths.
- made Sigil's Well-Formed Check (Sanity Check) more robust to whitespace parsing rules and allowed it to detect and report missing XML Headers
- we have upgraded to use Qt 6.7.2 and Python 3.11.9 for the base of our Windows and MacOS releases
- added a Bookmark Location toolbar icon right beside the Back button for easier use
- Opening EditTOC, SpeckcheckEditor or MetaDataEditor will now highlight the first line entry
- Add new Tool: Rebase OPF Manifest IDs on Current Filenames
- Update to 3rdparty PCRE2 version 10.44 for bug fixes
- General code cleanup to remove unneeded hacks and workarounds for old Qt bugs now fixed
