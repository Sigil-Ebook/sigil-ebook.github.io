Sigil 2.5.0 represents a large set of bug fixes and new features. The most significant of these is the addition of an AppImage build of Sigil for Linux that is feature for feature equal to the builds we make for MacOS and Windows.

__Notes:__

The Sigil Linux AppImage is built on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) and is targeting glibc 2.35 and higher. Use ldd --version to see if your system at least has a shot at being able to use the AppImage. Don't forget to make sure the AppImage is executable after downloading. Trouble is not expected but be safe and backup your existing Sigil preferences (if you have any) before trying the AppImage. This is especially important if you're currently using a pre-2.0 version of Sigil.

The latest version of the Sigil User Guide can always be [downloaded from the Sigil website](https://sigil-ebook.com/sigil/guide), or from its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/sigil-user-guide/releases/latest).

Please check the [Sigil website](https://sigil-ebook.com/sigil) for important Sigil support links, additional resource downloads, and platform-specific trouble-shooting tips/requirements.

The MacOS builds are signed AND notarized.
