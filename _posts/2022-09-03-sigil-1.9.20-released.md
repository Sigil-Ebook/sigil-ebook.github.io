This release represents a mix of bug fixes and new features:

### Bug Fixes
- double width of new Find Replace icons to make them easier to access
- improve new Find Replace icon tooltips to be include short name on top
- fix bug that caused file rename changes to fail when updating smil
- Metadata Editor will now strip out unneeded xmlns:dc attributes on dc tags
- Metadata Editor is now more robust to language codes that have incorrect case in the metadata
- clarify Create HTML ToC menu entry works from existing ToC
- prevent indavertent "\" chars be treated like escapes when updating metadata
- fix MetaEditor nit of not auto adding "aut" role to Author metadata for epub2
- make Spellcheck Editor count align column numerically (right)

### New Features
- add ability for a user-template*.xhtml and user-template*.css be read from Sigil Prefs to create new empty xhtml and css files
- updated to very latest MathJax version 3.2.2 for mathml support in Preview
- add ability to cycle through 2 different custom stylesheets (and none at all) for use with Preview

__Attention Linux Packagers:__  Starting with Sigil v1.9.20, MathJax 3.2.2+ is required to render MathML in Sigil's Preview Window. If you do nothing different with your Sigil builds, our custom bundled version of  MathJax 3.x will be included and things will work. If you wish to use your system version of MathJax v3, make sure 1) Your version of  MathJax is at least 3.2.2, and b) use the new CMake define `-DMATHJAX3_DIR=` to  supply the path to your MathJax 3.2.2+ location.  If you were using `-DMATHJAX_DIR=` to build/package Sigil in the past, it will do nothing with Sigil 1.9.20+. We did this on purpose so that no breakage of Sigil's MathML rendering would occur. Check Sigil's build documentation for details.

__Notes:__

The only installer that's appropriate for Windows 7 is the installer with "Legacy" in the name.
