This release is a maintenance release of the 0.8.x series and fixes a few critical bugs. Currently 0.8.x is the being maintained for critical fixes while the 0.9.0 is being worked on. You can find binary packages [here](https://github.com/user-none/Sigil/releases/tag/0.8.5) and the change log, [here](https://github.com/user-none/Sigil/blob/0.8.5/ChangeLog.txt).

Finally, the sha256 checksum for the checksum file is c34fe0e4d5d7fac3347a23e0644b1e72c6250579cc1939c625911d03800e967f. The Mac package is signed by my signing key (John Schember) and 10.9.5 is the minimum OS X version but it was built and tested on 10.10. The Windows builds were built on Windows 7.
