PageEdit 2.5.0 is a mix of bug fixes and new features.  The most significant of these is the addition of an AppImage build of PageEdit for Linux that is feature for feature equal to the builds we make for MacOS and Windows.

### Other Changes in this Release

### New Features
- update MacOS, Windows, and AppImage builds to use Qt 6.8.2
- improve light to dark theming for Linux
- when launched via Sigil's External Xhtml Editor during editing of an xhtml file in CodeView, the cursor in PageEdit will attempt to sync to the current editing position

### Bug Fixes
- fix bug when current MainWindow geometry was not being saved
- change WebProfileMgr to use off-the-record profiles until Qt profile creation bugs get fixed

__Notes__:

The PageEdit Linux AppImage is built on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) and is targeting glibc 2.35 and higher. Use ldd --version to see if your system at least has a shot at being able to use the AppImage. Don't forget to make sure the AppImage is executable after downloading. Trouble is not expected but be safe and backup your existing PageEdit preferences (if you have any) before trying the AppImage. This is especially important if you're currently using a pre-2.0 version of PageEdit.

The latest PageEdit user guide can always be [downloaded from the PageEdit website](https://sigil-ebook.com/pageedit/guide), or from its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/pageedit-user-guide/releases/latest).

The MacOS builds are signed AND notarized.
