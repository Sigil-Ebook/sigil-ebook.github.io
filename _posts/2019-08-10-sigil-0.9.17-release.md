__For the impatient, the installer files (and source) can be found as assets at the bottom of [the Sigil Github Release page](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases/tag/0.9.17).__

Sigil-0.9.17 is primarily a bug fix release for bugs that were uncovered after our port to QtWebEngine.

### Bug Fixes:

*   fix missing python3 network certifications on macOS
*   do not apply named entities in Preserve Entities to epub3 epubs
*   fix build docs for macOS
*   prevent FlowTab destructor race crash when opening a new book (Linux, Mac, Windows)
*   fix suggestions for built-in en\_US dictionary by adding “x” to the TRY list
*   fix plugins adding and deleting ncx under epub3
*   throw exception in plugins when epub2 tries to add or delete the ncx
*   fix bad Warning message about missing nav.xhtml file that was not missing
*   fix CodeView to Preview sync breakage due to minimize/restore
*   fix CodeView to Preview sync breakage due to attempting to load the Preview before it  
    finished loading the last update
*   fix sigil\_bs4 to work with latest python lxml 4.4.X in a backwards compatible manner
*   fix missing Preview to CodeView sync on Qt versions 5.9.X and 5.10.X
*   fix segfault on app close related to the PreviewWindow update timer firing at a bad time
*   fix CodeView to Preview syncing loss caused by spurious load finished signals
*   fix macOS specific bug that allowed multiple MainWindows to become tabs

### New Features

*   add a python3 plugin module navprocessor.py for plugin devs
*   show Preview by default (tabified with TOC) for new installations of Sigil

Be aware that Sigil-0.9.17 no longer enforces the need for epub3 to have and support an NCX for the purposes of backward compatibility with epub2 reading systems. There are, however, built-in tools to allow users to add backward compatibility features such as the NCX to their epub3.
