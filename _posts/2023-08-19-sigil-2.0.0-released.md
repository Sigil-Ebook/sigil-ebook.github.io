This release represents a mix of bug fixes and new features. Key points are the upgrade to Qt6.5.2 and Python 3.11.3 and the change to PySide6 instead of PyQt5/6 availability for plugins (see [here](https://sigil-ebook.com/blog/sigil-v2/) for more details). We will also no longer be providing an official Windows 32-bit binary installer (legacy or otherwise). The update to Qt6.5.2 makes Windows 10 (1809) the minimum supported OS for the official version of Sigil starting with Sigil 2.0.0.  Similarly, it makes the minimum supported MacOS version as 11.0 (Big Sur).
