Sigil version 2.4.0 represents a mix of bug fixes and new features.  Also note that the Microsoft VC++ runtime redistributable is no longer being bundled in the Sigil Windows installer starting with version 2.3.1. This should already be installed on any Windows PC that Sigil is supported on.


### Changes in this Release

####  New Features
- added a GetInfo dialog and right click menu option for XHTML files that provides a collection of information specific to that file without having to run Reports (including a word count)
- added support for multiple semantics per xhtml file, while uncommon is technically allowed by the spec
- made debugging with VS IDE easier
- streamlined Sigil logos and installer for Windows
- improve Sigil Well-Formed (sanity check) to better identify errors with missing attribute quotes
- update to Qt 6.7.3 and its PySide6 version for MacOS and Windows release builds
- updates to building on linux documentation
- add support for building with and using virtual python environments on Windows and Linux
- change Replacement Chooser to use Checkboxes to determine if replacements should be made, no deletes
- allow Windows Sigil installer to run on Windows arm64
 
#### Bug Fixes
- readability improvments for Load Warnings (thank you BeckyEbook)
- remove xhtml meta charset information after converting to utf-8 on initial load to prevent encoding errors
- forced the Preferences KeyboardShortcuts assign and remove buttons into the tab focus chain
- PR #778 building Sigil with recent Qt versions that no longer accept the QT_IMPLICIT_QCHAR_CONSTRUCTION macro
- fixes for using QTimeZone to prevent build warnings where possible (modified version of PR #779)
- fixes for better whitespace handling in TagLister codebase
