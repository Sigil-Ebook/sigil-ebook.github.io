    (see commits 94a28d7, 9f7ebba, and 4b968a9)

### New Features

*   Add filename to tab tooltip (commit 27f8db7)
*   Clear memory caches when Preview changes to keep memory footprint smaller (commit 87b9247)

Be aware that Sigil-0.9.13 still enforces the need for epub3 to have and support an NCX so that it generates as backward a compatible epub as possible. This may be relaxed in future releases.
