PageEdit 2.2.0 is primarily a bug fix release.  It contains a large number of third party bug and security fixes, so we strongly recommend you update to it.

### Changes in this Release
- use patched Qt 6.6.2 to fix huge memory leak when resizing QWebEngineView on macOS
- fix broken URLEncodePath that prevent proper insertion of Media (image, audo, video)
