__Attention Linux Packagers:__  Starting with Sigil v1.9.20, MathJax 3.2.2+ is required to render MathML in Sigil's Preview Window. If you do nothing different with your Sigil builds, our custom bundled version of  MathJax 3.x will be included and things will work. If you wish to use your system version of MathJax v3, make sure 1) Your version of  MathJax is at least 3.2.2, and b) use the new CMake define `-DMATHJAX3_DIR=` to  supply the path to your MathJax 3.2.2+ location.  If you were using `-DMATHJAX_DIR=` to build/package Sigil in the past, it will do nothing with Sigil 1.9.20+. We did this on purpose so that no breakage of Sigil's MathML rendering would occur. Check Sigil's build documentation for details.
