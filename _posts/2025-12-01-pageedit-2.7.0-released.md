__Notes__:

The PageEdit Linux AppImage is built on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) and is targeting glibc 2.35 and higher. Use ldd --version to see if your system at least has a shot at being able to use the AppImage. Don't forget to make sure the AppImage is executable after downloading. Trouble is not expected but be safe and backup your existing PageEdit preferences (if you have any) before trying the AppImage. This is especially important if you're currently using a pre-2.0 version of PageEdit.

The latest PageEdit user guide can always be [downloaded from the PageEdit website](https://sigil-ebook.com/pageedit/guide), or from its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/pageedit-user-guide/releases/latest).

The MacOS builds are signed AND notarized.

__All PageEdit binary downloads (and source) can be found as assets at the bottom of [the PageEdit 2.7.0 Github Release page.](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit/releases/tag/2.7.0)__
