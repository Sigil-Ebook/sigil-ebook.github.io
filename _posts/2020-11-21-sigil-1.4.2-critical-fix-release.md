### Bug Fixes Since Sigil-1.4.0:

*   critical bug fix for incorrectly xml encoding of opf metadata attributes that use entities
*   fix bug in “Add Existing” files when file names would require percent encoding
*   fix bug in multiple language spellchecking dialog word lookup when no language attributes used
*   update de, nl, sv, ko, ru translations that missed the Sigil 1.4.0 initial release
*   critical bug fix for _over_ xml encoding html used inside metadata in the opf

If you are using either Sigil-1.4.0 or Sigil-1.4.1, we __strongly urge you to upgrade to Sigil-1.4.2.__
