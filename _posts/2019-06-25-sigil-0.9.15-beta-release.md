A Beta Release of Sigil ported to QtWebEngine to replace QtWebKit

## New Features

*   ported to use QtWebEngine (based on Chromium) to replace QtWebkit
*   QtWebEngine plugs many major memory leaks. Memory footprint should stay low to moderate.
*   QtWebEngine has ongoing security and support patches from Qt/Google/Chromium
*   removes the broken/deprecated BookView Editor that relied on QtWebKit
*   created PageEdit app (that uses QtWebEngine) that replaces much BookView functionality (see <https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit>)
*   allows the user to control use of javascript and remote access by epubs when editingto improve overall security
*   adds action to launch one preferred external xhtml editor via shortcut or icon (can be used to fast launch PageEdit app or any other xhtml open-with editor)
*   adds 5 more plugin quicklaunch buttons to main menu for a total of 10 (with all new icons! Thanks so much Becky!)

It also includes all of the fixes and updates from Sigil-0.9.14.

Be aware that Sigil-0.9.15 still enforces the need for epub3 to have and support an NCX so that it generates as backward a compatible epub as possible. This may be relaxed in future releases.
