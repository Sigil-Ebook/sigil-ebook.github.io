__For the impatient, the installer files (and source) can be found as assets at the bottom of [the Sigil Github Release page](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases/tag/0.9.16).__

The first Official Release of Sigil ported to QtWebEngine to replace QtWebKit. And yes … [Book View is still really gone](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/wiki#yes-book-view-is-really-gone). But the companion external editing application [PageEdit is available](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit/releases/latest) for those who still need/want a similar functionality.

### New Features

*   added epub3 tool: Generate NCX/Guide for epub2 e-readers
*   added epub3 tool: Remove NCX and Guide
*   added right click on link in Preview copies url to clipboard
*   added check mark indicator for current semantic set in AddSemantics dialog
*   opf guide is no longer used/updated in epub3, unless new epub3 tool menu is used 
*   harden Sigil against maliciously crafted epub zip archives (aka zip-slip attacks)
*   added bk.getnavid() to the plugin framework and navprocessor.py for plugin devs
*   updated build documents to the latest Qt 5.12.3 and Python 3.7.2)

### Bug Fixes

*   add missing title tag to nav head to make epubcheck happy
*   add dcterms:modified to empty epub 3 opf to keep epubcheck happy
*   fix lost Preview-CodeView sync when internal links are followed in Preview
*   fix macOS specific bug with newer versions of PIL (Pillow) used by plugins
*   no longer link against unused Qt frameworks when building (thank you eli-schwartz!)
*   prevent MS VC++ automatic reboots during Windows installs
*   prevent user from changing semantics of the nav file itself (it must be set to “toc”)
*   fix bug that dropped nav from spine when HTML TOC created

Be aware that Sigil-0.9.16 no longer enforces the need for epub3 to have and support an NCX for the purposes of backward compatibility with epub2 reading systems. There are, however, built-in tools to allow users to add backward compatibility features such as the NCX to their epub3.
