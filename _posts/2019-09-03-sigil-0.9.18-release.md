__For the impatient, the installer files (and source) can be found as assets at the bottom of [the Sigil Github Release page](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases/tag/0.9.18).__

Sigil-0.9.18 represents a mix of new features and bug fixes.

### Bug Fixes:

*   fix bug in macOS that caused spurious warnings about missing file in the manifest
*   hopefully fix macOS bug about launching files using open-with from Desktop
*   make sure JQuery gets loaded before starting to use Preview javascript functions
*   fix local links during split that incorrectly used target filename for internal link
*   create GetEnvironmentVar to make access to environment variables more cross-platform
*   fix macOS bug when hitting close on the title bar of MainWindow causing strange window behaviour
*   hopefully fix macOS segfault on close by disabling Preview timer immediately
*   fix Windows 7 issues when running batch (.bat) files via OpenExternally (open with)
*   all error messages are now properly logged
*   fix improperly disabled open-with menu in Image Tabs popup context menu
*   removed use of Qt obsolete methods in About and Error Dialogs

### New Features

*   enable use of SIGIL\_DEBUG\_LOGFILE environment var to control saving debug output to a file
*   properly update the ncx after merging xhtml files
*   properly warn users if a multiple rendition epub (multiple OPF files) has been loaded
*   make Sigil’s external XHtml editor work to pass an OPF file (see PageEdit new features)
*   Allow epub3 metadata editor to edit primary meta tags
*   Replace buggy cssutils module used in plugins with our own drop-in replacement fork: css-parser
*   Updated Mac, Windows, and Linux build documentation

Be aware that Sigil-0.9.18 no longer enforces the need for epub3 to have and support an NCX for the purposes of backward compatibility with epub2 reading systems. There are, however, built-in tools to allow users to add backward compatibility features such as the NCX to their epub3.
