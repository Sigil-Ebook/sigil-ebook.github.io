As of today I’m retiring from being part of Sigil. Nothing nefarious just lack of time (mainly) and motivation. This doesn’t mean the end of Sigil. Kevin Hendricks and Doug Massay have been working on Sigil with me for months now. I’m leaving it in their very capable hands.

To accommodate this transition I’ve created a GitHub organization for Sigil’s code. Kevin and Doug will be added as maintainers very soon. This way it’s not dependent on a repository connected to my personal account. Also there will be a 0.8.7 release which updates all the links to point to the new code location.

It’s been fun, bye.
