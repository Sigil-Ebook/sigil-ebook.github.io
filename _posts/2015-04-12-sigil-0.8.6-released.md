This release is a maintenance release of the 0.8.x series and fixes a few critical bugs that could cause Sigil to crash. You can find binary packages [here](https://github.com/user-none/Sigil/releases/tag/0.8.6) and the change log, [here](https://github.com/user-none/Sigil/blob/0.8.6/ChangeLog.txt).

Finally, the sha256 checksum for the checksum file is ~~732773ec4fc73ab2ba29584130833b53d96c6c1296c433d889f2cd4b55d565be~~. The Mac package is signed by my signing key (John Schember) and 10.9.5 is the minimum OS X version but it was built and tested on 10.10. The Windows builds were built on Windows 7.

__Edit April 14, 2015.__

There was an issue with the Mac Package where it would crash instead of opening. A new build has been uploaded. The new checksum for the checksum file is __b05880c62ecd63a20225e13fc3868ea5520fe5f2e498842c542b1f32d525fee1__.
