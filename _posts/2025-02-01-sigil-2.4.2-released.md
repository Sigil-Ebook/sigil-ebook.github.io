Sigil version 2.4.2 is primarily a bugfix release with one new feature.  It fixes a number of issues related to Python 3.13+ use. Also note that the Microsoft VC++ runtime redistributable is no longer being bundled in the Sigil Windows installer starting with version 2.3.1. This should already be installed on any Windows PC that Sigil is supported on.


### Changes in this Release

####  New Features
- Added new tool: 'Update OPF Manifest Media Types' to set unrecognized media types based on actual file contents
 
#### Bug Fixes
- ensure CodeView code highlighting colors coincide with dark/light themes on certain Linux DEs
- fix sigil-gumbo gumboc to work with Python 3.13+ - ie. work around backwards incompatible changes in ctypes
- fix Replacement Chooser table to allow for multiple line row heights in Before and After fields (regression)
- prevent too many warnings when no media types provided in OPF by generating the warning collectively
- prevent build warnings by using hunspell's std:string interface (not C char * ones)
- fix files in third party code that used latin-1 encoding to now use utf-8
- fix old use of 'python' in python code header lines to always use 'python3'
- removed user scope installs from winget util they work properly with dependencies
- restore Find&Replace if it was open when the user tries to exit Sigil and then aborts the exit
