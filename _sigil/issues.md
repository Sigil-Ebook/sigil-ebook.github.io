<div markup="1">
The [Sigil issue tracker](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/issues) is for development issues that are actively being worked. It is not a user support system. It is meant solely for development and for developer to developer communication. If you just need help then head over to the [Support Page](../support).

Feature requests opened on the issue tracker will be closed if there isn't anyone willing to implement the requested feature. Only items being worked will be left open.
