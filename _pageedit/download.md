Past and present installers are always available under [releases](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit/releases) at the main code hosting location. The latest release will be on top. You can see what's changed between releases by looking at the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt).

<div markdown="1">
Note that PageEdit currently provides a Windows installer for x64 and will only work on Windows 10 (1809) or newer. Mac OS X binaries are typically one version behind the current release. This means that today 13 is the current release, so it should run on the 11 (with the latest updates installed). However, this is subject to change and this information is not always current. Especially for OS X. This is an at best support for older versions of Windows and OS X.
